# Resturaunt_Management
What if there was a restaurant management system for managers which helped manage the restaurant? Normally restaurant or fast food managers use spreadsheets to make shift schedules, track orders. But this is inefficient. This program will do all that but in a more efficient manner. It will create shifts using manager inputs, it will also track orders, and employees Furthermore, this program can only be used by the manager and no other employee. I call it RMS, restaurant management system, just like POS point sales system but much better and not just for sales.
